		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>My family LOVES bread pudding, and this recipe is one that I have fine tuned to their taste. I have to double this recipe, and bake it in a 9x13 inch pan for my family! It's great for breakfast or dessert and is delicious with milk poured on top! Enjoy!</p>
		
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>6 slices day-old bread</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
			<li>½ cup raisins (Optional)</li>
			<li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
			<li>2 cups milk</li>
			<li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
			<li>Break bread into small pieces into an 8 inch square baking pan. Drizzle melted butter or margarine over bread. If desired, sprinkle with raisins.</li>
			<li>In a medium mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. Beat until well mixed. Pour over bread, and lightly push down with a fork until bread is covered and soaking up the egg mixture.</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until the top springs back when lightly tapped.</li>
		</ol>
